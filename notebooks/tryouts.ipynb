    "# Smart Data Quality Agent - Demo Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Does\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the complete Smart DQ Check workflow with enhanced null analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schema Indexing** - Automatically discovers and indexes database tables (must run for first time) - No CDC logic applied as no requirement related defined on task description\n",
    "2. **Smart Analysis** - Uses AI to understand your query and analyze the right tables  \n",
    "3. **Enhanced Report Generation** - Creates comprehensive data quality reports with detailed null analysis in multiple formats\n",
    "4. **Fixed Null Analysis Issue**: Enhanced agent prompt to ensure detailed null values breakdown is always included\n",
    "5. **Complete Data Coverage**: Reports now show per-column null counts and percentages\n",
    "6. **Multi-Format Output**: All formats (Markdown, HTML, JSON) contain complete null analysis details\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "### **For Comprehensive Analysis:**\n",
    "1. **First Time Setup**: Run indexing cell to build schema index and discover your database tables\n",
    "2. **Run Analysis**: Following cell prompts for your query - try examples like:\n",
    "   - \"Generate comprehensive DQ report for prod customers table\"\n",
    "   - \"Create data quality report for production database invoices\"\n",
    "3. **Get Reports**: System generates detailed reports saved to `../reports/` in 3 formats (.html, .json, .md)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **For Single Quality Check Analysis:**\n",
    "1. **Run Schema Indexing** (same as above - required for all analysis types)\n",
    "2. **Choose Single Check Type**: Run the specific cells for focused analysis:\n",
    "   - **Duplicate-Only**: Run duplicate analysis cell for just duplicate detection\n",
    "   - **Null-Only**: Run null analysis cell for just missing values detection\n",
    "   - **Statistics-Only**: Use query \"Check statistics for [table]\" in comprehensive cell\n",
    "3. **Faster Execution**: Single checks run much faster than comprehensive analysis\n",
    "4. **Focused Reports**: Each single check creates a targeted report file (e.g., `duplicate_only_analysis.md`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use Each Approach:**\n",
    "- **Comprehensive**: When you need complete data quality overview with all checks and in all report formats\n",
    "- **Single Check**: When investigating specific issues or need quick focused analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reports being saved under reports folder shows:**\n",
    "- **Duplicate Record Analysis** - Complete duplicate detection and counts\n",
    "- **Detailed Null Values Assessment** - Per-column breakdown with counts and percentages  \n",
    "- **Statistical Summaries** - Comprehensive data profiling with descriptive stats\n",
    "- **Actionable Recommendations** - Data quality improvement suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Just run all cells in order and follow the prompts**"

      "1. **Establish Data Quality Framework**\n",
      "   - Only 33% of checks passed. Consider implementing: 1) Data validation at ingestion, 2) Regular quality monitoring, 3) Data stewardship roles, 4) Quality metrics dashboards.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: High\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Implement Null Handling Strategy**\n",
      "   - Columns `supplier`, `description`, `brand` have 5-20% null values. Consider implementing NOT NULL constraints, data validation rules, or imputation strategies based on business logic.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: Medium\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Investigate High Variability in `weight`**\n",
      "   - Column `weight` has high variability (CV=5.39). Review for outliers, data entry errors, or consider data transformation/normalization techniques.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: Low\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Investigate High Variability in `rating`**\n",
      "   - Column `rating` has high variability (CV=2.29). Review for outliers, data entry errors, or consider data transformation/normalization techniques.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: Low\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Data Documentation and Profiling**\n",
      "   - Dataset has 25 columns. Consider creating data dictionaries, establishing column-level monitoring, and implementing regular statistical profiling to track data drift over time.\n",

      "1. **Establish Data Quality Framework**\n",
      "   - Only 33% of checks passed. Consider implementing: 1) Data validation at ingestion, 2) Regular quality monitoring, 3) Data stewardship roles, 4) Quality metrics dashboards.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: High\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Implement Null Handling Strategy**\n",
      "   - Columns `supplier`, `description`, `brand` have 5-20% null values. Consider implementing NOT NULL constraints, data validation rules, or imputation strategies based on business logic.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: Medium\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Investigate High Variability in `weight`**\n",
      "   - Column `weight` has high variability (CV=5.39). Review for outliers, data entry errors, or consider data transformation/normalization techniques.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: Low\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Investigate High Variability in `rating`**\n",
      "   - Column `rating` has high variability (CV=2.29). Review for outliers, data entry errors, or consider data transformation/normalization techniques.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: Low\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Data Documentation and Profiling**\n",
      "   - Dataset has 25 columns. Consider creating data dictionaries, establishing column-level monitoring, and implementing regular statistical profiling to track data drift over time.\n",

      "1. **Implement Null Handling Strategy**\n",
      "   - Columns `COMPANY`, `PHONE`, `ADDRESS` have 5-20% null values. Consider implementing NOT NULL constraints, data validation rules, or imputation strategies based on business logic.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: Medium\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enhance Data Quality Processes**\n",
      "   - 67% pass rate indicates room for improvement. Implement automated quality gates, exception handling, and proactive monitoring for sustained quality.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: Medium\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **High Cardinality in CUSTOMER_ID**\n",
      "   - Column `CUSTOMER_ID` has very high cardinality (36,483 unique values). Consider data normalization, categorization, or indexing strategies for performance.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: Low\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **High Cardinality in PHONE**\n",

      "   - *Priority*: Low\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **High Cardinality in ADDRESS**\n",
      "   - Column `ADDRESS` has very high cardinality (33,731 unique values). Consider data normalization, categorization, or indexing strategies for performance.\n",
      "   - *Priority*: Low\n",

      "6. **High Cardinality in ACCOUNT_BALANCE**\n",

      "   - *Priority*: Low\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Data Documentation and Profiling**\n",
      "   - Dataset has 22 columns. Consider creating data dictionaries, establishing column-level monitoring, and implementing regular statistical profiling to track data drift over time.\n",
